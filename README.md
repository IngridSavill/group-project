# Yoobee Group Project !

## Dependencies (stuff that needs to be installed)

Ruby 
NPM
(Should be installed on Yoobee computers, may need to be installed on your personal computer)

## Instructions

1. Navigate to your project, `cd /your/project/directory`.
2. Run NPM, `npm install`.
3. Run Gulp, `gulp`. Alternatively run `gulp [task]`.
4. Simple as that. What Gulp is doing here is essentially the same as what Compass does, converting the Sass to CSS.

## Git Procedure

We will work from Git as we have in class. In order to prevent conflicts ensure job assignment is super clear so we don't end up overwriting each other's code or something terrible like that.

When making a commit the -m message should follow the format '24:00 DD/MM/YY'

## Sass

When making styling changes we will work from the stylesheets within src/sass

## Framework

We will be making use of the Bootstrap grid system. Please note we are ONLY using the grid system. The default stylings of Bootsrap have been stripped out.
